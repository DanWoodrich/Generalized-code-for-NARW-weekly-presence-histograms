# Scripts for visualizations of temporal presence data 

1.Create-weekly-presence-histograms: This is a code for automatically generating weekly presence histograms from datasets that have binary daily presence classifications, in this case determined by passive acoustic analysis. The script accounts for multiple locations, long or medium length time periods, and gaps in data.

2. Monthly-Presence-Map-Maker: This is a code for generating maps using daily presence data, and presenting it by drawing circles that increase in size with increased monthly presence.

Dummy datasets for download included in both scripts.
